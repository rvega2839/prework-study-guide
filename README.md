# <Basics-of-Fullstack-Web-Development>

## Description

As an approaching-future student of a UCF bootcamp, I needed a place where I could store all the important notes worth saving. This webpage was built for the purpose of storing past, present, and future notes from different subjects in order to interact with them in an organized fashion. Now me and fellow students can visit the website and refresh our minds when we forget how do something. I learned how to merge the ideas of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a webpage.

## Usage

Interacting with the webpage is easy. It clearly shows the different subjects with notes directly under them. The notes include information ranging from simple things to remember, to full-blown steps on how to complete a specific task (It is important to note that this information is limited). Open DevTools to see JavaScript running by right-clicking anywhere on the page, selecting the inspect button, and then selecting console. You can then see that it suggests what to study next at a random fashion every time the page is reloaded.
